## Vision

Provide a cohesive modeling environment where planners, surveyors, and developers collaborate on INTERLIS datasets with confidence.

## Roadmap highlights

1. **End-to-end testing** – Introduce lightweight browser smoke tests to cover validation workflows and diagram previews.
2. **Schema insights** – Surface interactive diagrams in the IDE using the `interlis.uml` command output.
3. **Knowledge base** – Publish more recipes and domain examples contributed by the community.

## How to contribute

- Join discussions on GitHub and share which workflows matter most to you.
- Submit issues when you encounter bugs or missing features in the LSP or IDE packages.
- Document your findings in blog posts or the documentation site—pull requests are welcome!
