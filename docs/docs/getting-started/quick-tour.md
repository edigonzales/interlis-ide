## Core modeling experience

- **Live validation with diagnostics** – Every open or saved `.ili` file is compiled with ili2c, surfacing warnings and errors directly in the Problems panel so you can correct issues immediately.
- **Context-aware completions** – Intelligent suggestions for imports, type references, and model names are derived from real-time compilation results and discovered repositories, helping you write correct schemas faster.
- **Precise navigation tools** – Jump straight to definitions, inspect document symbols, and rename INTERLIS elements across files while keeping references synchronized.

## Productivity boosters

- **Semantic editing aids** – Semantic highlighting, on-type templates, and cached compilation results keep the editor responsive and aligned with the INTERLIS specification.
- **Formatting and templates** – Apply ili2c's pretty printer to entire documents and expand boilerplate blocks for models, topics, classes, or structures with a single keystroke, including metadata placeholders and matching `END` statements.
- **Caret-aware automation** – Auto-inserted templates respect the cursor position so you can continue typing without manual adjustments.

## Visualization and documentation

- **Diagram generation** – Produce Mermaid or PlantUML class diagrams from compiled models and review them directly within the IDE, with options to download generated visuals.
- **Rich documentation exports** – Create HTML guides or styled DOCX manuals from INTERLIS models, complete with customizable titles and metadata.
- **Integrated output channel** – Follow compiler logs and background tasks in a dedicated output pane that refreshes with each new validation run.

## Seamless workspace integration

- **Syntax-aware explorer** – Work with INTERLIS-specific grouping and filtering in the explorer to navigate large model collections efficiently.
- **Command palette actions** – Trigger compilation, diagram previews, and documentation exports through dedicated commands that streamline everyday workflows.
- **Bundled runtime** – A self-contained language tooling stack ships with the IDE for consistent team setups while still allowing advanced users to point to custom installations when needed.
