## Explorer

The explorer lists INTERLIS files grouped by model. Context menus provide shortcuts for validation, schema exports, and previewing compiled
transfer files. Use the filter input to quickly switch between topics when working on larger projects.

## Editor

The editor surface integrates semantic highlighting, go-to-definition, inline diagnostics, and intent-based code actions. Hovering over
keywords reveals documentation sourced from the INTERLIS specification. Multi-file rename ensures references stay consistent across models.

## Problems panel

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac
turpis egestas. Curabitur aliquam metus ac nisl condimentum, vitae tristique nunc fringilla.

## Outline

The outline view is powered by the LSP symbol provider and surfaces domains, classes, and associations. Clicking an element centers it in
the editor, and you can drag entries to reorder declarations when reorganizing a schema.

## Status bar

Use the status bar to track the active namespace, toggle validation modes, and switch between INTERLIS versions. Notification badges
highlight background tasks such as model imports or external validator runs.
