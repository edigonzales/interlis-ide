# Visual Studio Code and Theia Support

At the moment you get all the features of the INTERLIS IDE when using Visual Studio Code or VSCodium together with the [INTERLIS editor extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=edigonzales.interlis-editor). Since a Java runtime is bundled with the extension, everything works out of the box.

This can change in the future if we add more features that are not realizable within a simple VS Code extension.

You can also use the pure [Eclipse Theia IDE](https://theia-ide.org/) and install the very same extension. There is even a Docker image for Theia IDE that provides the browser-based application.
