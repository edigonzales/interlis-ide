description: Discover the INTERLIS-focused IDE experience and how the documentation is organized.
---

INTERLIS IDE is a tailored development workspace for the INTERLIS geolanguage. The project brings together a Java-based
Language Server Protocol (LSP), a VS Code extension, and rich tooling built on top of Theia. This documentation site helps you
install the tooling, explore core workflows, and contribute to the ecosystem.

## How this guide is organized

- **Getting Started** – Install the IDE, connect to the INTERLIS LSP, and import your first models.
- **Language Server** – Dive into the Java LSP implementation, its capabilities, and how the VS Code extension communicates
  with it.
- **IDE Guides** – Learn domain workflows such as catalog validation, schema evolution, and integration with geodata tools.
- **Reference** – Consult configuration keys, CLI helpers, and troubleshooting recipes when something misbehaves.
- **Community** – Understand the roadmap and how to collaborate on INTERLIS tooling initiatives.

Each section links to relevant GitHub repositories, sample models, and external specifications so you never lose context while
building your spatial data solutions.

## What you need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 20 or newer to build the documentation and run the local dev server.
- A recent version of INTERLIS IDE, the VS Code extension, or any LSP-compatible editor if you plan to try out the examples.
- Familiarity with INTERLIS concepts such as models, topics, and structures makes the feature guides more actionable, but we
  also provide conceptual refreshers along the way.

## Quick start

1. Follow the [installation guide](getting-started/installation.md) to set up the IDE and documentation locally.
2. Complete the [project setup walkthrough](getting-started/project-setup.md) to index an INTERLIS model and use language
   intelligence features.
3. Explore the [capabilities reference](language-server/capabilities.md) to understand how diagnostics, navigation, and
   formatting are implemented.
