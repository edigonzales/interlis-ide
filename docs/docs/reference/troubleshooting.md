## Language server does not start

- Verify that `java --version` prints a Java 17+ runtime.
- Check the output channel for `interlis/log` notificationsâ€”missing models are often reported there.
- Enable verbose tracing by setting `"interlisLsp.trace.server": "verbose"` in your workspace settings.

## Validation results look stale

malesuada tincidunt.

## Diagram generation fails

- Ensure PlantUML or Mermaid support is available in your deployment environment.
- Confirm the workspace has write access to the temporary directory used to render diagrams.
- Retry after clearing caches via the command palette: `INTERLIS: Reset language server`.
